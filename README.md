# GISDay_workshop_2021

This notebook will walk you through some basic techniques of conducting <b>Interative Mapping and Data Visualization</b> in the CyberGIS-Jupyter environment. We will retrieve the latest COVID-19 data from the [Illinois Department of Public Health](https://dph.illinois.gov/covid19/data/data-portal.html) (IDPH) website, examine and preprocess the data, make plots of daily new cases by counties using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), create an interactive map with [ipyleaflet](https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to visualize weekly channge of new cases across the state, and finally link map and plot together. 

After finishing this notebook, you will have a "app-style" notebook like the screenshot below. You are encouraged to tweak the codes a little bit to visualize other COVID-19 indices, such as deaths and testings.
