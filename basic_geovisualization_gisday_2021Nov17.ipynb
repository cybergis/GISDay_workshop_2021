We then look back for another week and caculate the same metric (cases_last_week). The weekly change rate is (cases_current_week - cases_last_week)/cases_last_week * 100%, and is calculated county by county. If the resulting number is postive (or negative), that means we are getting more (or less) cases than last week. The magnitude shows how fast the situation is changing, and we will use different colors to repreent them on the map. There is an edge case: if no new cases reported for the last week (cases_last_week=0), the change rate will become infinity as the denominator is 0. The pandas dataframe is able to handle it. \n",
